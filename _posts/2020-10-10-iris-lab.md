the iris species with the longest petals on average is virginica
the iris species with the widest sepals on average is setosa

at first i wanted to simply add onto the ReadingFiles homework and average the lists of values of each species. however, i realised that the code to do that would only be applicable to this specific dataset, and that if more species were to be added or the dataset changed in some way, i would have to re-write the code. 

i decided to write a function that averages the data of any given value (petal length, petal width, etc.) for all the iris species.
much like the ReadingFiles homework, i started with a for loop that would sort all of the data into lists in a dictionary by species:

~~~
for current_row_data in file_data:
    current_iris_species = current_row_data["species"]
    current_iris_data = current_row_data[field_to_average]
    if current_iris_species not in species_to_values:
        species_to_values[current_iris_species] = []
    species_to_values[current_iris_species].append(float(current_iris_data))
~~~

when calling on the funtion, one could then choose any field of data that they'd want to average the values of, in this case, i averaged the petal lengths, and the sepal widths of all the species.

~~~
str(sum(species_to_values[species]) / len(species_to_values[species]))
~~~
