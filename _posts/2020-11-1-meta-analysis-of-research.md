I decided to analyze a study on the [effectiveness of online consumer product reviews](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315571921_Effectiveness_of_Online_Consumer_Reviews_The_influence_of_source_trustworthiness_valence_reviewer_ethnicity_and_social_distance) by Jaebong Son, Dan J. Kim, and Chang E. Koh. The authors stated that while a substantial academic effort has been made to analyze the effectiveness of online reviews, those studies have been primarily based on qunatitative factors such as review length and star ratings, as opposed to the more qualitative factors like the actual content of the review. The authors compared two reviews for the same product, and judged the effects of characteristics like different word choices on the uncertainty of the buyer. The first review was quite brief: "Great phone for the price. Camera takes pictures of excellent quality." The second review is longer and describes the users experience with more detail. It uses keywords/phrases like "easy to use", "intuitive", and "simple". They discovered that reviews including consumers ease of use experience, reviews conveying the aestheic and design of the products, and reviews that included examples of customers sound experiences, are more helpful votes than those without. The authors findings seem quite sound and I don't think the "publish or perish" mentality played a big role in the paper in terms of affecting results.
