## about me
I've taken computer science 1 & 2 at Horace Mann. I've also been on FTC team 4326 for two years, but I spent most of my time there doing hardware as opposed to software. I am currently taking pre-calculus.

I'm looking forward to designing the lighting for the middle division show this year. The play, _Our Town_ by Thornton Wilder, is a metatheatrical three-act play which won the [Pulitzer Prize for drama](https://www.pulitzer.org/page/history-pulitzer-prizes) in 1938. We plan on performing the three acts seperately at three different times throughout the coming school year.
