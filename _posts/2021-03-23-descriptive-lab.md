for this lab i worked with the "new coder survey" dataset
the first variable i looked at was the age of the participants
the mean age was around 28 years old
when i looked at a histogram showing the distribution of ages, i saw that the graph was skewed to the right

then, i looked at the relationship between age and city population
i generated a bar plot that showed that older people tended to live in less populated areas than younger people, this makes sense because older people would probably live in more rural areas.
